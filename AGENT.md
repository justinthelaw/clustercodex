# AGENT.md

## Start here

- Product vision, scope, architecture diagram, and workflow: [README.md](README.md)
- Local setup, dev workflow, and test commands (including ancillary infra): [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Architectural plan, MVP scope, and phased checklists (primary execution blueprint): [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)

## How to collaborate with me

### Source of truth

Use [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) as the primary blueprint. It is where my coding agent and I collaborate on what to build (architecturally) and how to phase the MVP implementation together. This is a living document and should be kept accurate as requirements evolve.

Before implementing changes, review [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the developer's usual local setup, dev workflow, and ancillary infrastructure expectations.

### Phased delivery

The phases and checkboxes in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) are the step-by-step execution plan. I will point you to the next phase when I want you to implement it, and I may ask you to modify:

- The phase goals and acceptance criteria
- The architecture and constraints earlier in the document

Treat that file as the canonical plan, keep it updated if requirements change, and align your edits with the current phase checklist.

## Operating expectations for Codex

- Follow repo conventions and existing patterns.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested phase.
- If you need details that are not in [README.md](README.md) or [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md), ask once, then proceed.
